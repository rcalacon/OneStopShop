2. Project Description
My CS646 Final Project is called OneStopShop, a phone application meant for users to create grocery
lists to be used when visiting the market. Users can select an item from a pre defined list of
groceries to add it to his/her own personal list. Users can also delete items from his/her list and
search for specific items in the fully populated grocery list. There are 826 items total.

Users can only see items they've selected from the grocery list.

I got the grocery list data from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/prashantk93/inventory-data-for-grocery
Some further massaging was done to the data in order for it to be usable (deleted some duplicates,
added UIDs for personal use). I also ended up using only column E from the data set, which is the
product name.

A combination of UI design, progress bars, toasts and snackbars are used to provide the user more
information.

3. Special Instructions
On startup the application will take the grocery list data from the saved file in the /res/raw
directory. It will then write all of this information into the firebase db. This may take a while
but the application will inform you of it's progress. This only happens once and a subsequent
application restart should be much faster.

You need to register for an account to see the full capabilities. I will stage the database so no
accounts will be made and you should be able to create any username you want. The application checks
 if the user exists before and when you submit the registration form. Credentials get stored in
 firebase db.

The application also verifies credentials when logging in.

5. Known Issues
No known issues, but the following capabilities are listed as "under construction". When interacting
 with these items in the app, a Snackbar will display telling the user the feature is under
 construction.

*** Home Fragment ***
Edit Button - I would like to one day support the ability to edit a grocery for further
customization. A potential edit feature could be to provide the duration of the grocery, so the app
can notify you when you are almost out (maybe by a push notification). The list can also then be
color coded to tell you if you are running out or not (e.g. red row = 1 day away from running out)

*** Groceries Fragment ***
Create Button - I would like to have a user be given the ability to create a custom grocery, in case
 it doesn't currently exist in the predefined list provided

*** Settings Fragment ***
Dark Theme Switch - Fairly self explanitory, but I'd like to support the trendy dark theme

Notification Settings - Based off of the Edit Button feature above, I'd like users to configure when
 the app should let them know they are running low on groceries. (e.g. 2 days from now)

Clear Custom Groceries - Based off of the Create Button feature above, I'd like users to manage
their custom groceries by removing ones that are no longer needed.

I'd also like to support landscape views.
